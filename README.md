BitStream

---------

A tool to facilitate simple reading of a series of bit objects at a high speed. Contains a reader, writer and a 
data object to pass. The reader and writer allow simple linear reading/writing of a bit sequence, or alternatively
the ability to change individual bit/bytes. They will return or accept general primitives and byte arrays, as well
as using the BitSet and BitStream objects to split up bit objects.
